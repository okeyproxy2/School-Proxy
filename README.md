# School-Proxy
A school proxy serves as a mediator or a link between your devices and the desired website you aim to access. If you seek to access specific sites and browse without restrictions, here is a detailed guide on using a school proxy for you!

A [school proxy](https://www.okeyproxy.com/proxy/unblocking-websites-with-school-proxy-2024/) acts as an intermediary between your devices and the website you want to access. Instead of directly connecting to the website, the proxy establishes the connection on your behalf. It fetches the webpage, downloads it, and then forwards it to you. As a result, the website only sees the IP address of the proxy, not yours. Essentially, your interaction with websites is indirect, going through the proxy. From the perspective of internet filters, it appears as if your activity is limited to the proxy, masking your access to the actual website.

Choose school proxy servers that are unrestricted, compatible with various operating systems, and easy to set up. These proxies should offer unrestricted access to all websites and video platforms while ensuring your privacy and browsing history are protected.

# Methods for Unblocking Websites at School

Method 1: School Proxy

Using a school proxy is one of the simplest ways to unblock websites. Proxies hide your IP address and route your internet traffic through different public servers. Many proxies are designed to work with specific apps or browsers, making them user-friendly.

[OkeyProxy](https://www.okeyproxy.com/) offers over 150 million genuine residential IPs across 200 countries, ensuring broad accessibility in any region. Their proxies support scraping and targeted data collection tasks, with high access to residential and mobile proxies for authentic data collection.

Method 2: VPN

By using a VPN, your connection is routed through a remote VPN server, which then connects you to the website. This conceals your actual IP address and enables you to bypass website restrictions. If you encounter a performance slowdown, there are ways to enhance your VPN speed.

Method 3: Google’s Cache

Google keeps local copies of websites to speed up loading times. This caching process operates similarly to your browser cache but on the server side. If you can’t access the original site, you might still be able to access its cached version.

Method 4: HTML to PDF Converter

If you don’t need direct access to the blocked website but want to view its content, use an HTML-to-PDF converter. This tool accesses the restricted URL on your behalf and converts it into a downloadable PDF document. Simply input the URL into a free HTML to PDF converter and click “Get PDF.”

Method 5: Chrome Extensions

Various browser extension proxies are tailored for popular browsers. These extensions function like a proxy website but are integrated directly into your browser, eliminating the need to visit a separate proxy site to unblock content.

3. Configure Web Browser: Access your browser’s settings and paste the proxy server’s IP address and port number in the appropriate fields. Save the changes.
